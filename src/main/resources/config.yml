resource_pack:
  # If this option is enabled, the plugin will create a resource pack that contains custom textures and models for custom items every time it gets enabled.
  # This pack will be served by a resource pack server that is started by the plugin.
  # Note: Running the server requires you to open a port on your firewall.
  #       If you are not able or willing to do this, you can also upload the resource pack to a 3rd party server (see below).

  prompt: "Please download the resource pack to use custom textures and models."
  3rd_party:
    # Instead of running the resource pack server, you can also upload the built VE resource pack (/plugins/VanillaEnhancements/resourcepacks/pack.zip) on a 3rd party server.
    # This is useful if
    # - you have a Bungeecord or CloudNet network and want to use the same resource pack on all servers
    # - your server host does not allow you to run a resource pack server
    # - your server is behind a firewall and you cannot open the port for the resource pack server
