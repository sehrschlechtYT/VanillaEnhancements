# VanillaEnhancements

A collection of enhancements for the vanilla minecraft gameplay (on spigot servers).

## Current State of the project

I started working on this project in october 2021 and stopped development in december 2021.  
I'm currently reviving the project. As the code quality is very bad, it'll need many changes until I can release a first version.
